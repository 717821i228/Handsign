Hand Sign Classification:
Description:
  This project,focus on identifying the Hand Sign using Deep learning methods.
Convolutional Neural Network [CNN] is the algorithm used because,CNN algorithm learn features in a matrix format
and compare it with the image data to classify .
Realtime:
  This can be useful for blind people as they cannot see,this method recognize sign and intimate through voice assistant to 
particular person.
  Also it can be used to control device through hand gesture .For example,if a person is taking seminar, he can change from one slide to another 
slide or to previous slide by waving a gesture movement.
